A patch for **Xbox Consoles** and **Microsoft Store** has been published today!  

This patch was in submitted prior to the game's launch, so won't reflect every issue that's been brought to us. Everything reported by the community is currently being worked on!  

The Xbox version of the game is catching up with what we released on steam, so you may be asking yourself:  

> ## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i> Why is the Xbox version not in-sync with steam?  
>
> When it comes to consoles, the game is done and tested first on Steam, then it gets to be adapted to console by a porting house. From that, Microsoft's standard procedure is to runs tests across the whole game and then we get the go ahead to have it updated!
